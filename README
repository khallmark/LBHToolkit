LBH Toolkit is a set of PHP classes I’ve had to write for various projects. They
represent pieces of functionality that had poor or no support available as I 
searched in internet.

The code is available on GitHub.

You will need to initialize the library submodule to use this repository. Run the following
commands:

git submodule init
git submodule update

then you can run: git pull inside the library directory. You can pull the library
directly for direct inclusion.

Here is an outline of what is available:

LBHToolkit
	Google
		Geocode - object oriented access to the Google Maps Geocode API
	TableMaker - a Zend Controller Helper to programmatically construct html tables
	vCard
		Generator – an object oriented class for generating vCards
